//why javascript ?
//html is not smart enough to perform any logical work apart from displaying the given data in a better way
    //it can't do math, in the example below it simply displayed what we typed
    //it can't figure out if someone has correctly filled out a form
    //it can't make decisions based on how a web visitor interacts with it.
    //basically, html lets people read text, look at pictures, watch videos and click liks to move to other web pages with more text
    //javascript can create smart web forms that let visitors know when they've forgotten to include necessar information
    //javascript makes elements appear, disappear, or move around a web page
    //in short javascript lets you make your websites more engaging effective and useful
